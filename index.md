## About Me

I am a researcher with a focus on Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Models. I recently completed my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://irlab.science.uva.nl/">IRLab</a> of the <a href="https://uva.nl/">University of Amsterdam</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.kanoulas/">Evangelos Kanoulas</a> and <a href="https://andrewyates.net/">Andrew Yates</a>.

During my Ph.D., I interned at *Microsoft Research* in Nairobi and the *Amazon* search team in Barcelona. Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist at *bol.com*. I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/">University of Amsterdam</a>, and a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.auth.gr/en/">A.U.Th.</a>

You can find my CV <a href="https://krasakis.com/assets/files/Krasakis_CV.pdf">here</a>.
