## About Me

I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Information Retrieval Lab at the University of Amsterdam. 
During my PhD I interned at *Amazon Search* Barcelona and prior to that I worked as a Data Scientist at *bol.com*.
I have a Master's Degree in Data Science from the University of Amsterdam and a Diploma of Electrical and Computer Engineering from A.U.Th. (Aritstotle University of Thessaloniki).

## Research Interests

- **Information Retrieval:** Conversational Search, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Dense Retrieval and Learned Sparse Retrieval
